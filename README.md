# My First Docker + NGINX Project

This is my very first Docker project! ðŸŽ‰  

It uses **Docker** and **NGINX** to serve a simple HTML page inside a container.

## Features

- Custom HTML page running inside a Docker container
- Powered by NGINX
- Easy to build and run locally
## Run the container
```bash
docker build -t my-website:latest.
```
## Open the browser and visit
